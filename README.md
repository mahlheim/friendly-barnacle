## Description
This app can be used to write and save notes. Through the use of an express.js back end, this app will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

## Installation
You can clone the repository to your local machine, install the dependencies and run the app locally or, for ease, the app can also be accessed [here](https://module-11-expressjs-challenge-288f150d826c.herokuapp.com/) via heroku! 

## Usage
Navigate to the homepage and click the "Get Started" button. This will take you to the note pad, so to speak. Give your new note a title in the area labeled "Note Title", as well as a body in the area labeled "Note Text". Then, hit the save button in the upper right hand corner to add your new note to the list of saved notes on the left side of the screen. When you are done with a note, locate the note you wish to delete in the saved note section and click on the little trash can icon to the right of the note's title.
